//! PubGrub version solving algorithm.
//!
//! It consists in efficiently finding a set of packages and versions
//! that satisfy all the constraints of a given project dependencies.
//! In addition, when that is not possible,
//! PubGrub tries to provide a very human-readable and clear
//! explanation as to why that failed.
//! Below is an example of explanation present in
//! the introductory blog post about PubGrub
//!
//! ```txt
//! Because dropdown >=2.0.0 depends on icons >=2.0.0 and
//!   root depends on icons <2.0.0, dropdown >=2.0.0 is forbidden.
//!
//! And because menu >=1.1.0 depends on dropdown >=2.0.0,
//!   menu >=1.1.0 is forbidden.
//!
//! And because menu <1.1.0 depends on dropdown >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
//!   which depends on intl <4.0.0, every version of menu
//!   requires intl <4.0.0.
//!
//! So, because root depends on both menu >=1.0.0 and intl >=5.0.0,
//!   version solving failed.
//! ```
//!
//! The algorithm is generic and works for any type of dependency system
//! as long as packages (P) and versions (V) implement
//! the [Package] and Version traits.
//! [Package] is strictly equivalent and automatically generated
//! for any type that implement [Clone] + [Eq] + [Hash] + [Debug] + [Display].
//!
//! ## API
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::convert::Infallible;
//! # use pubgrub::{resolve, OfflineDependencyProvider, PubGrubError, Ranges};
//! #
//! # type NumVS = Ranges<u32>;
//! #
//! # fn try_main() -> Result<(), PubGrubError<OfflineDependencyProvider<&'static str, NumVS>>> {
//! #     let dependency_provider = OfflineDependencyProvider::<&str, NumVS>::new();
//! #     let package = "root";
//! #     let version = 1u32;
//! let solution = resolve(&dependency_provider, package, version)?;
//! #     Ok(())
//! # }
//! # fn main() {
//! #     assert!(matches!(try_main(), Err(PubGrubError::NoSolution(_))));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Where `dependency_provider` supplies the list of available packages and versions,
//! as well as the dependencies of every available package
//! by implementing the [DependencyProvider] trait.
//! The call to [resolve] for a given package at a given version
//! will compute the set of packages and versions needed
//! to satisfy the dependencies of that package and version pair.
//! If there is no solution, the reason will be provided as clear as possible.
